    <h1>There Is No A.I.</h1>
    <p>
        As a computer scientist, <strong>I don’t like the term “A.I.”</strong> In fact, I think it’s misleading—maybe even a little dangerous.
         Everybody’s already using the term, and it might seem a little late in the day to be arguing about it. 
         But we’re at the beginning of a new technological era—and the easiest way to mismanage a technology is to misunderstand it.
         The term “artificial intelligence” has a long history—it was coined in the nineteen-fifties, in the early days of computers.
         More recently, computer scientists have grown up on movies like <strong>“The Terminator”</strong> and <strong>“The Matrix,”</strong> and on characters like Commander Data,
         from “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” These cultural touchstones have become an almost religious mythology in tech culture.
         It’s only natural that computer scientists long to create A.I. and realize a long-held dream.
